Flexbox training
https://evenclan.github.io/Pokemon-site/

This is my second week/project in a bootcamp training project and a first one using flexbox and I'm quite happy with the result. 
It is, to a certain extend, a template site - Same as in my previous excercise I had a picture (and some tips along with it) of a ready site that I had to recreate.
I didn't quite liked the boring look of it so i came with my own idea of how it may look like. 

What i learned here was:
1) Flexbox in general - The idea of a flexbox, its properties and how to use them in a real environment.
2) pseudo-elements such ass ::before or ::after as well as .class:hover::after or .class:first-of-kind
3) Navigation dropdown menu
4) More CSS in general.

To do list: 
1) Translate text into english (Perhaps)
2) Style navigation bar a little bit more. 
3) Some tweaks. Will see =)
